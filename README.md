# Description
This project encapsulates the directory structure required for the final project in CS322. 

Additionally, it contains an ant build.xml file you can use to buid/compile/clean your project if you wish. 

The goal of this project is to use ANTLR to create lexers and parsers for our language grammer "KnightCode". Using ANTLR building the parse tree, we implemented a Listenr method to translate/walk. This project also use ASM to do all the calcualtion

# ColdPotatoes_CP4
The program was crated by Maitham Alghamgham, Bobby Gabriel.

### Building BaseListener 

	 antlr4 KnightCode.g4 -o lexparse

### how to Comile the Comiler with ANT:
Refer to the build.xml file for the build/clean targets.

Assuming that you imported build.xml, knightcode.g4 and everything 

	 This script will enable you to convert a program from KnightCode to Java Source Code.
     build-grammar - ant will parse the grammar files.
     clean-grammar - ant will clean and delete all relevant files.
     compile-grammar - ant will compile the java files.
     compile-knightcode - ant will compile the java files but will not compile the parser files.
     run-compiler - ant will attempt to run the compiler. Used for basic test runs.
	 
#1 build-grammar runs clean-grammar
#2 compile-grammar, compile-knightcode, and run-compiler require build-grammar to be run prior to their use.
#3 compile-grammar runs compile-knightcode automatically.
#4 run-compiler runs compile-grammar automatically.
#5 run-compiler only tests the first program. Other programs must be manually entered.

### How To Run the Compiler to Compile a .kc File:

Keep in mind, that it is crucial that you specify the file types after entering each file name or else the program will not run correctly. 

Here is an example of a successful program;

		java kcc tests/program1.kc output/Program1
